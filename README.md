# Sample-Wordpress-Site

This is my first full exploration into wordpress.

The theme that I set up is called "startwordpress" and is based on this article: https://www.taniarascia.com/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/.

To view it go to wordpress > wp-content > themes > startwordpress
It should all be there.
